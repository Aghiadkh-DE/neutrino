# Neutrino

Neutrino is a versatile OCR (Optical Character Recognition) software tool designed to streamline the organization of documents by employing visual scanning techniques to sort PDFs and images into designated directories.

## Features

- **Visual Scanning**: Neutrino utilizes advanced image processing algorithms, including the Tesseract machine learning model from Google, to scan and analyze the content of PDFs and images, enabling efficient sorting based on visual cues.
- **Directory Management**: Easily create and manage directories to organize your documents according to your preferred categorization system.
- **Intuitive Interface**: The user-friendly interface makes it simple to navigate and interact with Neutrino, even for users with minimal technical expertise.
- **Customizable Settings**: Tailor Neutrino to suit your specific document organization needs with customizable settings and preferences. Adjust performance settings to increase or decrease processing speed as needed.
- **System Shutdown**: Neutrino offers the option to automatically shut down the system after processing is completed, providing convenience and energy efficiency.
- **Multilingual Support**: Neutrino supports over 60 languages, allowing users to process documents in various languages with ease.

## How It Works

1. **Upload Documents**: Import your PDFs and images into Neutrino's interface.
2. **Visual Analysis**: Neutrino scans the content of each document, utilizing the Tesseract machine learning model and other algorithms to identify visual patterns and characteristics.
3. **Automated Sorting**: Based on the analysis results, Neutrino automatically sorts the documents into designated directories.

## Getting Started

To get started with Neutrino, you have two options:

- **Using Compiled Code (Windows and Linux)**:
  1. **Installation**: Compile the code using JDK 17+.
  2. **Setup**: Configure Neutrino settings according to your preferences, including directory structure, performance settings, and language options.
  3. **Import Documents**: Upload your PDFs and images into Neutrino's interface.
  4. **Run Analysis**: Initiate the visual scanning process to analyze the content of the documents.

- **Using Binaries (Windows)**:
  1. **Installation**: Download and install Neutrino binaries directly onto your Windows system from the official website or repository.
  2. **Setup**: Configure Neutrino settings according to your preferences, including directory structure, performance settings, and language options.
  3. **Import Documents**: Upload your PDFs and images into Neutrino's interface.
  4. **Run Analysis**: Initiate the visual scanning process to analyze the content of the documents. (Note: Linux binaries are not yet set up; compiling the code is the only way to use it on Linux)
